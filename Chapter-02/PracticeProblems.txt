PRACTICE QUESTIONS

1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

 The two values are:
   True
   False

  The first letter should be uppercase and the rest in lowercase.


2. What are the three Boolean operators?
  
  and
  or
  not


3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator.

   (i)and
    
    True and True        True

    True and False       False

    False and True       False

    False and False      False

  
   (ii)or

    True or True         True

    True or False        True

    False or True        True

    False or False       False


   (iii)not

    not True      False

    not False     True


4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

 (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)          False

 not (5 > 4)                   False

 (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)           True

 not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))     False

 (True and True) and (True == False)      False

 (not False) or (not True)     True


5. What are the six comparison operators?

  ==      Equal to

  !=      Not equal to

  <       Less than

  >       Greater than

  <=      Less than or equal to

  >=      Greater than or equal to  


 6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?

  Equal to operator contains 2 equal sign(==)
  It checks if the LHS is equal to RHS

  Assignment operator has 1 equal sign(=)
  It assigns The RHS value to the variable at LHS


7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.

  Boolean Expressions can be considered as a condition.
  Conditions always evaluate down to a Boolean value, True or False.
  A flow control statement decides what to do based on whether its
  condition is True or False, and almost every flow control statement
  uses a condition.


8. Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
print('spam')


  The three blocks are everything inside if statement and print('bacon') and print('ham')


9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, 
 prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam,
 and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

   if spam == 1:
    print('Hello')
   elif spam == 2:
    print('Howdy')
   else:
    print('Greetings!')


10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?

  Ctrl C


11.What is the difference between break and continue?

  break will take the execution of the code out from the loop.
  continue will take the execution of the code to the starting of the loop.


12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) 
 in a for loop?

  There is no difference between these 3.
  They all execute the same thing.


13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. 
 Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

  for i in range(1,11):
  print(i)
  


  i=1
  while i<=10:
    print(i)
    i=i+1


14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam,
 how would you call it after importing spam?

 spam.bacon()
